Virtualization has been a topic of high importance in Computer Science since the 1960s. The subject has been researched intensively, with many advances in technology, both in the form of hardware additions and software techniques. In recent years, the evolution of embedded devices has made them a viable candidate for virtualization. The following research project explores the possibility of using this technology on devices built around the ARMv7 family of processors.
